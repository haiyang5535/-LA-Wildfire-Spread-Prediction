# -LA-Wildfire-Spread-Prediction
This project aims to predict wildfire spread in Los Angeles, California, to enhance fire management strategies and improve resource allocation for effective wildfire control.

Skills used:
Data Collection and Cleaning: Aggregated and preprocessed wildfire, weather, and geospatial data from various sources.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducted trend analysis and visualizations to understand key factors driving wildfire spread.
Machine Learning Modeling: Built predictive models using regression and classification techniques to estimate wildfire spread and identify high-risk areas.
Geospatial Analysis: Used tools like GeoPandas and Folium for mapping and analyzing spatial data related to wildfires.
Data Visualization: Created interactive maps and plots to communicate insights effectively.
