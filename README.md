# -LA-Wildfire-Spread-Prediction
This project is aimed to predict wildfire spread in Los Angeles, California, in order to enhance fire management strategies and improve resource allocation for future effective wildfire control.

Skills used in this project:

Data Collection and Cleaning: Aggregated and preprocessed wildfire, weather, and geospatial data from various sources.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducted trend analysis and visualizations to understand key factors driving wildfire spread.

Machine Learning Modeling: Built predictive models using regression and classification techniques to estimate wildfire spread and identify high-risk areas.

Geospatial Analysis: Used tools like GeoPandas and Folium for mapping and analyzing spatial data related to wildfires.

Data Visualization: Created interactive maps and plots to communicate insights effectively.
