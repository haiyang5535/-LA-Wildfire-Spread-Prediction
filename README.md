# LA-Wildfire-Spread-Prediction
This project is aimed to predict wildfire spread in Los Angeles, California, in order to enhance fire management strategies and improve resource allocation for future effective wildfire control.

Skills used in this project:<br/>

**Data Collection and Cleaning**: Preprocessed wildfire, weather, and geospatial data from various sources.<br/>
**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Looked at trends in the data and made visualizations to see what factors influence how wildfires spread.<br/>
**Machine Learning Modeling**: Built models to predict how far wildfires might spread and which areas are most at risk.<br/>
**Geospatial Analysis**: Used tools like GeoPandas and Folium to map wildfire locations and analyze spatial data.<br/>
**Data Visualization**: Created clear and interactive maps and charts to share findings in an easy-to-understand way.<br/>
